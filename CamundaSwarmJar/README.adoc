= Datasource via Fraction in WAR file

> Please raise any issues found with this example in our JIRA:
> https://issues.jboss.org/browse/SWARM

This example demonstrates how to create a datasource through fraction
configuration. It is exactly like the datasource-fraction example,
except is uses `<packaging>war</packaging>` to demonstrate using a
custom main with a WAR file.

Refer to the datasource-fraction example readme for details of what
the main is doing.
